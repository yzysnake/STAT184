# Activity: Popular Names


## Instructions 
- You will complete the Popular Names Activity found in the Data Computing eBook <https://dtkaplan.github.io/DataComputingEbook/project-popular-names.html>  
    - You will choose at least four (4) names for the activity
    - One name must be yours (even if there is no data for your name)
    - The other three names can be any names you like as long as they have data in `BabyNames` (friends, family, public figures, etc)
    - The plot shown at the beginning is the **goal** for the end of the activity, **NOT** the first task in the activity.
- every step in the activity should have narrative text describing your observations; many steps also require code chunks and corresponding output.

- Submit the completed R Notebook to Canvas before deadline
