- In Task 2, one of the prompts asks "What were the variable(s) that will be added?"  To clarify, you are looking for any variable(s) now existing in the `Corrected` data frame, that had not been available in the the `OrdwayBirds` data frame.

- In Task 4, feel free to use `esquisser()` or `mPlot()` to create the bar graph and generate the required `ggplot2` code for your R code chunk.
