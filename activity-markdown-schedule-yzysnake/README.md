# Activity: Markdown Schedule

- Use the template `ScheduleActivity.Rmd` to create a document that describes **at least three classes/hobbies/jobs** on your weekly schedule this semester (Note: you can replace 1-2 classes with hobbies, clubs, jobs, etc)
- Students may help one another, but each student must submit his/her own original work to be graded.
- You need to make at least 3 commits--pushed to GitHub--that show incremental progress as you complete the assignment (e.g., one to initialize the project, one after each topic you describe, others for editing etc)
- Each topic must be accompanied by an embedded image & working link to a public website related to the topic (e.g., Wikipedia--not Canvas).
- Help each other, share Rmd tips, use RStudio Cheat Sheets, post questions/answers/syntax to Piazza


### What to Submit

- Submit your completed **R Notebook** to Canvas before the deadline


### Grading

This activity is worth a total of 10 points:

- [1.5 points] Submitted document is an R Notebook (with the "Code" button in top right--see Hints below...)  
- [1 point] Name and Due Date is correct
- [1.5 points] at least three (3) "commits" with Git--"pushed" to GitHub) as you progress on the assignment  
- [1.5 points] Level 3 heading (`###`) for each class/topic (class, hobby, club, job, etc)  
- [1.5 points] One or two sentences of narrative text describing each class/topic  
- [1.5 points] working link to a public webpage relevant to your class/topic  
- [1.5 points] embedded image relevant to each topic (captions encouraged)  


### Hints 

- Make sure you submit an **R Notebook** and NOT some other type of document R Markdown can make.  Here are some tips to make sure you have the right one: 
    - RStudio automatically generates with ".nb.html" extension (like `ThiliniExample.nb.html`)
    - The R Notebook document (with ".nb.html" extension) should have a button at the top right that says "Code" which provides several options including "Download Rmd" (see `ThiliniExample.nb.html` for example)
- **Embedding Images**: Notice in `ThiliniExample.Rmd` that images can be embedded using a URL to a public webpage hosting the image (e.g., the drum set) or an image file in the Repo (e.g., tidyverse.png)  
- **Embedding Links**:  Make sure you choose public webpages.  Links to Canvas pages or things on your local computer will NOT work for the grader!
