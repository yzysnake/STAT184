# Class Schedule


### STAT 184: Introduction to R Programmaing

This is not the first time that I experience with R language. Since I'm major in data science, I already applied and used R language for some projects in other class. I'm glad to take the class this semester cause I can learn R language more systematically.

### RLST 1: World Religious

It introduces various religious in this world in an academic way. Basically, this course overlaps with many concepts related to anthropology, sociology, literary studies, and psychology. The course description is in (<https://bulletins.psu.edu/university-course-descriptions/undergraduate/rlst/>).


# Hobby

### Guitar

I learned it by myself since I was 8. I love it because it can help me relive my mood sometimes and keep myself energetic.
